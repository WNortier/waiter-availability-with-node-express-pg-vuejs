Your sister is running a coffee shop in town, she needs a web application to help her schedule weekly waiter shifts. Create a web application that can help her.

Waiters can:

select days they can work
update the days they can work on
Your sister wants to:

see how many waiters are available to work
reset the data to use the system for a new week
She needs 3 waiters for each day. Days for which there are enough waiters should be marked as green, days for which more waiters are needed still and days that are over subscribed should be highlighted accordingly.
